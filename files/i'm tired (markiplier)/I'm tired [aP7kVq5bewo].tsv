0	3280	Hello, I know what you're gonna say, so I'm going to cut you off at the pass.
3520	8580	Ordinarily, a YouTuber would be like, go to the comments, leave them, comment, drop them, comment.
9420	15000	I've been busy, if it wasn't apparent, and is usually the case whenever I'm not posting videos for a while,
15060	18120	it's because I'm working on other stuff that just needs my attention.
18740	20140	So that's what I've been doing.
20340	22880	And I'm saying this, which is in the text.
23140	25540	I don't know why I keep pointing up there, it hasn't been up there in years.
25540	29220	But I came here to say this, because I am tired.
30020	36180	And I kind of want to share that, because I haven't been able to share pretty much anything.
37100	45200	The amount of work that I've had to put into Iron Lung recently has been probably more than any other project that I've had to do.
45420	53000	In addition to having to learn so many different things that I thought I knew how to do, or I had a surface level knowledge of.
53000	56680	And I had to expand on that and expand on that and keep digging deeper.
56980	59100	And what's great is nothing.
59220	61520	And nothing is great, it's not great.
61600	63980	Long story short, I have been busy.
64540	66660	And I'm going to be busy for a little bit longer.
67480	70740	I know I've said these words before, and I know that they've lost all meaning.
70880	74760	But final stretch, the thing about a final stretch is that it can keep stretching.
75220	76300	And that's what it's been doing.
76560	77760	And that's what it's been doing to me.
77860	79320	I've been stretched very thin.
79320	82260	And that means that I just haven't been able to make videos.
82260	83320	And that sucks.
85380	86280	Like, it just does.
86360	88400	I want to say that out loud, because we all know it.
88440	90100	Like, you know it, I know it.
90160	93460	And that's why I said at the beginning of this, like, hold on, I know what you're going to say.
93580	95580	You don't need to say it, because I know it.
95580	97900	But it needs to be said, right?
98520	99940	Like, I'm very tired.
100820	105900	I've been busting my ass on this for, like, almost a year now.
105960	106840	And that's crazy.
107660	109640	Actually, over a year now, now that I think about it.
109920	113360	That's even crazier, because that's one unus onus, right?
113360	124400	It's very, not easy, but it's very simple to reduce things down to one year when you know exactly how much work goes into a year of working every day on something.
124900	127240	And that was a dishonest.
127300	129860	And I've been working on this longer than that.
130900	134120	Admittedly, there was a big strike in the middle of it, but it didn't mean the work stopped for me.
134180	141560	It was just like I got to try to get ahead on some problem solving and try to learn some things and try to get ahead in other areas.
141560	153640	And this all ties into something that I believe very intensely and that has led me to where I am today in terms of making content on YouTube, is that some things are worth pushing yourself for.
154100	157980	Some things are worth stretching yourself very thin for.
158160	166840	I would not be here if I did not throw myself in headfirst into things that I did not fully understand with all the confidence in the world that I would figure it out.
167620	169580	And no, I didn't land on my feet all the time.
169580	173380	I landed on my ass, head, and literally everywhere but my feet.
174480	176100	But I got through it, you know?
176380	180120	You can learn a lot of things about yourself and you can learn a lot of things that you didn't know you could do.
180240	185520	And I have, in this past year, learned a ton of shit that I can't talk about just yet.
186160	187180	Except I have.
187540	188180	That's the thing.
188260	192540	I have been talking about it on Distractable and Go My Favorite Sports Team.
192620	194400	If you didn't know, I have two podcasts.
194400	197000	And I've been keeping up with those regularly.
197000	208840	For me, mentally, talking with my friends and being able to have that sense of normalcy when I can't just do regular stuff by myself has been very peaceful and has been very nice.
208920	215400	And that's part of the reason why I started those podcasts with my friends is so that I could have a regular means with talking to them.
215400	221720	And just getting these thoughts out of my head and de-stressing about the things that have been pushing me.
221760	224640	But even now, I can't do that.
225240	226760	Because it is the final stretch.
226820	229300	And I have to do so much more.
230180	231600	Like, I'm not even close.
231700	233040	Like, I'm close to done.
233040	236460	But looking at the amount of work, I'm not even close to done.
237780	241940	And that's, you know, I mean, it's not good.
242780	246540	But it doesn't have to be good to be good later.
247120	247840	You know what I mean?
248220	249600	That's my philosophy.
249820	253060	Part of the creative process is not all sunshine and rainbows.
253460	255420	You know, it's bashing your head against a wall.
255460	256240	And I've been doing that.
256260	258280	And I'm very good at that, if you didn't know me.
258940	260240	I'm exceptionally good at that.
260240	264840	And in bashing my head against a wall, somehow my skull just gets thicker.
265040	266360	And my brain just gets bigger.
267180	270660	And my confidence in what I can do grows.
270820	271820	But also crumbles.
272160	272800	A lot.
273100	273780	A lot.
274120	274860	A lot.
275400	276540	That's part of it, too.
276720	276960	You know.
278100	280280	Just working on this has been a bear.
281000	286780	Working on this has been a big cement block tied to each shoe.
286780	289360	And now I'm going down in the ocean of blood.
290240	291240	But it's fun.
291420	291980	Or it will be.
292200	293540	Once I swim to the surface.
293840	294540	That's a trick.
294620	295720	I got to swim to the surface.
296120	297240	That's the only trick.
297600	299620	You're going down, jumping into a new project.
299700	300420	That's the easy part.
300620	302040	It turns out you just sink.
302620	307060	The rest of it, to either swim up to the top, if you have the skill to do that.
307080	309300	Or you walk along the bottom of the ocean.
309700	311220	And you crawl up on shore.
311420	312880	I don't know where this analogy is going.
312960	314320	But it seems weirdly fitting.
314420	315860	And also related to what I'm doing.
315860	317040	So I'm going to stick with it.
317200	318420	And I'm going to stick with this.
318820	322280	And I'm going to stick it out until the end of this project.
323080	326920	And that way, I can show you something cool.
326920	333540	And if this goes the way that it seems to be going, I'll get to do it again.
341980	343420	I'll get to do it again.
343560	344240	Yes, I will.
344340	345560	And I look forward to it.
345560	358880	That's, I, when I say I love doing this, like you can't, you can't tell me that I'm not telling the truth.
359440	366060	Because I really, I really can't wait to do it all over again.
366240	367740	I'm going to take a break after this is done.
367960	370220	After this movie comes out, I'm going to take a big old break.
370340	375000	And by break, I mean, I'm just going to focus on making YouTube videos for a little bit.
375000	376440	That sounds like fun.
376820	382600	And then maybe helping other people make some cool shit that doesn't have me involved in every step of the process.
382880	385200	That sounds kind of cool too.
386160	386960	So I'm going to do that.
387300	390120	But first, I'm going to go get ramen with Amy.
391020	392620	And then I'm going to play with Chica or something.
393280	394300	She's doing good, by the way.
394900	395300	So is Henry.
396100	396560	So am I.
397240	398180	Just a little stressed.
398460	398800	That's okay.
399240	400000	Just want to let you know.
400440	401740	So I'm going to get back to it.
402100	404580	And by to it, I mean the ramen thing that I'm doing.
404580	406360	And I promise I won't work for the rest of the night.
407860	408920	Even though it's like 8 p.m.
413500	413880	All right.
413920	414020	Bye.
