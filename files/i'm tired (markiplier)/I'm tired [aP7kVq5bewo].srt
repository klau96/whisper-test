00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Hello, I know what you're gonna say, so I'm going to cut you off at the pass.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,580
Ordinarily, a YouTuber would be like, go to the comments, leave them, comment, drop them, comment.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,000
I've been busy, if it wasn't apparent, and is usually the case whenever I'm not posting videos for a while,

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,120
it's because I'm working on other stuff that just needs my attention.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,140
So that's what I've been doing.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,880
And I'm saying this, which is in the text.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,540
I don't know why I keep pointing up there, it hasn't been up there in years.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,220
But I came here to say this, because I am tired.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:36,180
And I kind of want to share that, because I haven't been able to share pretty much anything.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:45,200
The amount of work that I've had to put into Iron Lung recently has been probably more than any other project that I've had to do.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:53,000
In addition to having to learn so many different things that I thought I knew how to do, or I had a surface level knowledge of.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,680
And I had to expand on that and expand on that and keep digging deeper.

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,100
And what's great is nothing.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,520
And nothing is great, it's not great.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,980
Long story short, I have been busy.

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,660
And I'm going to be busy for a little bit longer.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,740
I know I've said these words before, and I know that they've lost all meaning.

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,760
But final stretch, the thing about a final stretch is that it can keep stretching.

19
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,300
And that's what it's been doing.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,760
And that's what it's been doing to me.

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,320
I've been stretched very thin.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,260
And that means that I just haven't been able to make videos.

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,320
And that sucks.

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,280
Like, it just does.

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,400
I want to say that out loud, because we all know it.

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,100
Like, you know it, I know it.

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,460
And that's why I said at the beginning of this, like, hold on, I know what you're going to say.

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,580
You don't need to say it, because I know it.

29
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,900
But it needs to be said, right?

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,940
Like, I'm very tired.

31
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,900
I've been busting my ass on this for, like, almost a year now.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,840
And that's crazy.

33
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,640
Actually, over a year now, now that I think about it.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,360
That's even crazier, because that's one unus onus, right?

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:04,400
It's very, not easy, but it's very simple to reduce things down to one year when you know exactly how much work goes into a year of working every day on something.

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,240
And that was a dishonest.

37
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,860
And I've been working on this longer than that.

38
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,120
Admittedly, there was a big strike in the middle of it, but it didn't mean the work stopped for me.

39
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:21,560
It was just like I got to try to get ahead on some problem solving and try to learn some things and try to get ahead in other areas.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:33,640
And this all ties into something that I believe very intensely and that has led me to where I am today in terms of making content on YouTube, is that some things are worth pushing yourself for.

41
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,980
Some things are worth stretching yourself very thin for.

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:46,840
I would not be here if I did not throw myself in headfirst into things that I did not fully understand with all the confidence in the world that I would figure it out.

43
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,580
And no, I didn't land on my feet all the time.

44
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,380
I landed on my ass, head, and literally everywhere but my feet.

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,100
But I got through it, you know?

46
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,120
You can learn a lot of things about yourself and you can learn a lot of things that you didn't know you could do.

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,520
And I have, in this past year, learned a ton of shit that I can't talk about just yet.

48
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,180
Except I have.

49
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,180
That's the thing.

50
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,540
I have been talking about it on Distractable and Go My Favorite Sports Team.

51
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,400
If you didn't know, I have two podcasts.

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,000
And I've been keeping up with those regularly.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:28,840
For me, mentally, talking with my friends and being able to have that sense of normalcy when I can't just do regular stuff by myself has been very peaceful and has been very nice.

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,400
And that's part of the reason why I started those podcasts with my friends is so that I could have a regular means with talking to them.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,720
And just getting these thoughts out of my head and de-stressing about the things that have been pushing me.

56
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,640
But even now, I can't do that.

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,760
Because it is the final stretch.

58
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,300
And I have to do so much more.

59
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,600
Like, I'm not even close.

60
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,040
Like, I'm close to done.

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,460
But looking at the amount of work, I'm not even close to done.

62
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,940
And that's, you know, I mean, it's not good.

63
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,540
But it doesn't have to be good to be good later.

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,840
You know what I mean?

65
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,600
That's my philosophy.

66
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,060
Part of the creative process is not all sunshine and rainbows.

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,420
You know, it's bashing your head against a wall.

68
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,240
And I've been doing that.

69
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,280
And I'm very good at that, if you didn't know me.

70
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,240
I'm exceptionally good at that.

71
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,840
And in bashing my head against a wall, somehow my skull just gets thicker.

72
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,360
And my brain just gets bigger.

73
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,660
And my confidence in what I can do grows.

74
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
But also crumbles.

75
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,800
A lot.

76
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,780
A lot.

77
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,860
A lot.

78
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,540
That's part of it, too.

79
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:36,960
You know.

80
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,280
Just working on this has been a bear.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,780
Working on this has been a big cement block tied to each shoe.

82
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,360
And now I'm going down in the ocean of blood.

83
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
But it's fun.

84
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:51,980
Or it will be.

85
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,540
Once I swim to the surface.

86
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,540
That's a trick.

87
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,720
I got to swim to the surface.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,240
That's the only trick.

89
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,620
You're going down, jumping into a new project.

90
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,420
That's the easy part.

91
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,040
It turns out you just sink.

92
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,060
The rest of it, to either swim up to the top, if you have the skill to do that.

93
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,300
Or you walk along the bottom of the ocean.

94
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,220
And you crawl up on shore.

95
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,880
I don't know where this analogy is going.

96
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,320
But it seems weirdly fitting.

97
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,860
And also related to what I'm doing.

98
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,040
So I'm going to stick with it.

99
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,420
And I'm going to stick with this.

100
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,280
And I'm going to stick it out until the end of this project.

101
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,920
And that way, I can show you something cool.

102
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,540
And if this goes the way that it seems to be going, I'll get to do it again.

103
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,420
I'll get to do it again.

104
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,240
Yes, I will.

105
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,560
And I look forward to it.

106
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:58,880
That's, I, when I say I love doing this, like you can't, you can't tell me that I'm not telling the truth.

107
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,060
Because I really, I really can't wait to do it all over again.

108
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,740
I'm going to take a break after this is done.

109
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,220
After this movie comes out, I'm going to take a big old break.

110
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,000
And by break, I mean, I'm just going to focus on making YouTube videos for a little bit.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,440
That sounds like fun.

112
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,600
And then maybe helping other people make some cool shit that doesn't have me involved in every step of the process.

113
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,200
That sounds kind of cool too.

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,960
So I'm going to do that.

115
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,120
But first, I'm going to go get ramen with Amy.

116
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,620
And then I'm going to play with Chica or something.

117
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,300
She's doing good, by the way.

118
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,300
So is Henry.

119
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,560
So am I.

120
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,180
Just a little stressed.

121
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:38,800
That's okay.

122
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,000
Just want to let you know.

123
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,740
So I'm going to get back to it.

124
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,580
And by to it, I mean the ramen thing that I'm doing.

125
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,360
And I promise I won't work for the rest of the night.

126
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,920
Even though it's like 8 p.m.

127
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:53,880
All right.

128
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,020
Bye.
