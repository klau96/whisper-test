00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Hello, I know what you're gonna say, so I'm going to cut you off at the pass.

00:03.520 --> 00:08.580
Ordinarily, a YouTuber would be like, go to the comments, leave them, comment, drop them, comment.

00:09.420 --> 00:15.000
I've been busy, if it wasn't apparent, and is usually the case whenever I'm not posting videos for a while,

00:15.060 --> 00:18.120
it's because I'm working on other stuff that just needs my attention.

00:18.740 --> 00:20.140
So that's what I've been doing.

00:20.340 --> 00:22.880
And I'm saying this, which is in the text.

00:23.140 --> 00:25.540
I don't know why I keep pointing up there, it hasn't been up there in years.

00:25.540 --> 00:29.220
But I came here to say this, because I am tired.

00:30.020 --> 00:36.180
And I kind of want to share that, because I haven't been able to share pretty much anything.

00:37.100 --> 00:45.200
The amount of work that I've had to put into Iron Lung recently has been probably more than any other project that I've had to do.

00:45.420 --> 00:53.000
In addition to having to learn so many different things that I thought I knew how to do, or I had a surface level knowledge of.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.680
And I had to expand on that and expand on that and keep digging deeper.

00:56.980 --> 00:59.100
And what's great is nothing.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.520
And nothing is great, it's not great.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.980
Long story short, I have been busy.

01:04.540 --> 01:06.660
And I'm going to be busy for a little bit longer.

01:07.480 --> 01:10.740
I know I've said these words before, and I know that they've lost all meaning.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.760
But final stretch, the thing about a final stretch is that it can keep stretching.

01:15.220 --> 01:16.300
And that's what it's been doing.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.760
And that's what it's been doing to me.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.320
I've been stretched very thin.

01:19.320 --> 01:22.260
And that means that I just haven't been able to make videos.

01:22.260 --> 01:23.320
And that sucks.

01:25.380 --> 01:26.280
Like, it just does.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.400
I want to say that out loud, because we all know it.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.100
Like, you know it, I know it.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.460
And that's why I said at the beginning of this, like, hold on, I know what you're going to say.

01:33.580 --> 01:35.580
You don't need to say it, because I know it.

01:35.580 --> 01:37.900
But it needs to be said, right?

01:38.520 --> 01:39.940
Like, I'm very tired.

01:40.820 --> 01:45.900
I've been busting my ass on this for, like, almost a year now.

01:45.960 --> 01:46.840
And that's crazy.

01:47.660 --> 01:49.640
Actually, over a year now, now that I think about it.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.360
That's even crazier, because that's one unus onus, right?

01:53.360 --> 02:04.400
It's very, not easy, but it's very simple to reduce things down to one year when you know exactly how much work goes into a year of working every day on something.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.240
And that was a dishonest.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.860
And I've been working on this longer than that.

02:10.900 --> 02:14.120
Admittedly, there was a big strike in the middle of it, but it didn't mean the work stopped for me.

02:14.180 --> 02:21.560
It was just like I got to try to get ahead on some problem solving and try to learn some things and try to get ahead in other areas.

02:21.560 --> 02:33.640
And this all ties into something that I believe very intensely and that has led me to where I am today in terms of making content on YouTube, is that some things are worth pushing yourself for.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.980
Some things are worth stretching yourself very thin for.

02:38.160 --> 02:46.840
I would not be here if I did not throw myself in headfirst into things that I did not fully understand with all the confidence in the world that I would figure it out.

02:47.620 --> 02:49.580
And no, I didn't land on my feet all the time.

02:49.580 --> 02:53.380
I landed on my ass, head, and literally everywhere but my feet.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.100
But I got through it, you know?

02:56.380 --> 03:00.120
You can learn a lot of things about yourself and you can learn a lot of things that you didn't know you could do.

03:00.240 --> 03:05.520
And I have, in this past year, learned a ton of shit that I can't talk about just yet.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.180
Except I have.

03:07.540 --> 03:08.180
That's the thing.

03:08.260 --> 03:12.540
I have been talking about it on Distractable and Go My Favorite Sports Team.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.400
If you didn't know, I have two podcasts.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.000
And I've been keeping up with those regularly.

03:17.000 --> 03:28.840
For me, mentally, talking with my friends and being able to have that sense of normalcy when I can't just do regular stuff by myself has been very peaceful and has been very nice.

03:28.920 --> 03:35.400
And that's part of the reason why I started those podcasts with my friends is so that I could have a regular means with talking to them.

03:35.400 --> 03:41.720
And just getting these thoughts out of my head and de-stressing about the things that have been pushing me.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.640
But even now, I can't do that.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.760
Because it is the final stretch.

03:46.820 --> 03:49.300
And I have to do so much more.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.600
Like, I'm not even close.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.040
Like, I'm close to done.

03:53.040 --> 03:56.460
But looking at the amount of work, I'm not even close to done.

03:57.780 --> 04:01.940
And that's, you know, I mean, it's not good.

04:02.780 --> 04:06.540
But it doesn't have to be good to be good later.

04:07.120 --> 04:07.840
You know what I mean?

04:08.220 --> 04:09.600
That's my philosophy.

04:09.820 --> 04:13.060
Part of the creative process is not all sunshine and rainbows.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.420
You know, it's bashing your head against a wall.

04:15.460 --> 04:16.240
And I've been doing that.

04:16.260 --> 04:18.280
And I'm very good at that, if you didn't know me.

04:18.940 --> 04:20.240
I'm exceptionally good at that.

04:20.240 --> 04:24.840
And in bashing my head against a wall, somehow my skull just gets thicker.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.360
And my brain just gets bigger.

04:27.180 --> 04:30.660
And my confidence in what I can do grows.

04:30.820 --> 04:31.820
But also crumbles.

04:32.160 --> 04:32.800
A lot.

04:33.100 --> 04:33.780
A lot.

04:34.120 --> 04:34.860
A lot.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.540
That's part of it, too.

04:36.720 --> 04:36.960
You know.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.280
Just working on this has been a bear.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.780
Working on this has been a big cement block tied to each shoe.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.360
And now I'm going down in the ocean of blood.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.240
But it's fun.

04:51.420 --> 04:51.980
Or it will be.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.540
Once I swim to the surface.

04:53.840 --> 04:54.540
That's a trick.

04:54.620 --> 04:55.720
I got to swim to the surface.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.240
That's the only trick.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.620
You're going down, jumping into a new project.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.420
That's the easy part.

05:00.620 --> 05:02.040
It turns out you just sink.

05:02.620 --> 05:07.060
The rest of it, to either swim up to the top, if you have the skill to do that.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.300
Or you walk along the bottom of the ocean.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.220
And you crawl up on shore.

05:11.420 --> 05:12.880
I don't know where this analogy is going.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.320
But it seems weirdly fitting.

05:14.420 --> 05:15.860
And also related to what I'm doing.

05:15.860 --> 05:17.040
So I'm going to stick with it.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.420
And I'm going to stick with this.

05:18.820 --> 05:22.280
And I'm going to stick it out until the end of this project.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.920
And that way, I can show you something cool.

05:26.920 --> 05:33.540
And if this goes the way that it seems to be going, I'll get to do it again.

05:41.980 --> 05:43.420
I'll get to do it again.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.240
Yes, I will.

05:44.340 --> 05:45.560
And I look forward to it.

05:45.560 --> 05:58.880
That's, I, when I say I love doing this, like you can't, you can't tell me that I'm not telling the truth.

05:59.440 --> 06:06.060
Because I really, I really can't wait to do it all over again.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.740
I'm going to take a break after this is done.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.220
After this movie comes out, I'm going to take a big old break.

06:10.340 --> 06:15.000
And by break, I mean, I'm just going to focus on making YouTube videos for a little bit.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.440
That sounds like fun.

06:16.820 --> 06:22.600
And then maybe helping other people make some cool shit that doesn't have me involved in every step of the process.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.200
That sounds kind of cool too.

06:26.160 --> 06:26.960
So I'm going to do that.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.120
But first, I'm going to go get ramen with Amy.

06:31.020 --> 06:32.620
And then I'm going to play with Chica or something.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.300
She's doing good, by the way.

06:34.900 --> 06:35.300
So is Henry.

06:36.100 --> 06:36.560
So am I.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.180
Just a little stressed.

06:38.460 --> 06:38.800
That's okay.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.000
Just want to let you know.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.740
So I'm going to get back to it.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.580
And by to it, I mean the ramen thing that I'm doing.

06:44.580 --> 06:46.360
And I promise I won't work for the rest of the night.

06:47.860 --> 06:48.920
Even though it's like 8 p.m.

06:53.500 --> 06:53.880
All right.

06:53.920 --> 06:54.020
Bye.
